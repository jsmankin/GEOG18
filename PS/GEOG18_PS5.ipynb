How is climate data usually stored?\n","\n","Often times, climate data is stored in netCDF (.nc) format. Although we didn't go into detail about netCDF files, we already used the this type of file in Problem Set #3. netCDF files are commonly used in climatology, meteorology, and oceanography. They are able to store observed data to respective location on earth. \n","\n","Below I'm going to read in data from a \"[reanalysis](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/atmospheric-reanalysis-overview-comparison-tables)\" dataset. Essentially reanalysis uses a climate model to fill in the spatial and temporal gaps between observations. So it's not quite observations, it's not quite model output, it's something different. But it's often used in climate analysis because it is heavily vetted, is nearly observational, and is a powerful tool for climate research. So the data we're going to use comes from the [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html).\n","\n","We will be using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data to assess heat waves.
