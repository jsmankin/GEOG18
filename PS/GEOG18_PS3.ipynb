    "While Python offers a large range of packages for plotting spatio-temporal data, we will start with the most generic interface to create maps: `matplotlib`. Most of other Python packages used for plotting spatio-temporal data are based on matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something to keep in mind as you search for help on the internet when using `matplotlib` is that the library has two user interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The first mimics the plotting routines of a programming language called MATLAB, but instead uses Python.\n",
    "*   The second option is an object-oriented interface, which is much more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When plotting with `matplotlib`, it is very important to know and understand that there are two approaches even though the reasons of this dual approach is outside the scope of this PS.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the object-oriented [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) we need to create a new figure instance and then store it as its own variable; we call this variable `fig` but you can choose any name. As you'll see in a bit, this is what we will need to do when we want to create more than one figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok. So a figure can contain several plots (also called sub-plots) or just one plot. It's a vessel. A storage device, almost like a window. The first thing to do is to choose how many sub-plots your figure will contain. This is done with the add_subplot method:"

    "Let's plot 10 days of the [North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/teleconnections/nao/). The NAO, as you may recall from class, is mode of internal climate variability in the North Atlantic that influences Northern Hemisphere weather. The index itself is the difference in sea-level pressure (SLP) between a standing low pressure pattern near Iceland, [called the Iclandic Low](https://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=icelandic+low) and a subtropical standing high pressure pattern near the Azores, called [the Azores High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores_High). When this difference in pressure between the Icelandic Low and Azores High is large, the pressure gradient force is stronger, and so the winds in the jet stream move faster and straighter, steering storms into Northern Europe, rather than to the Mediterranean. This is the positive phase. The negative phase is when the difference between these two semi-permanent patters is smaller, which reduces the pressure gradient force and weakens the jet stream, leading to a meander in it that favors storms being steered farther south, to the Mediterranean."
