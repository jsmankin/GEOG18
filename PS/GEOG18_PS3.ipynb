Essentially, we want to ask the Google cloud computer we're running this PS on to go and download a version of the library we want and then to install it for us to use during this instance of Python we have here right now. The way we do that is to say `!pip install <library>`, where `<library>` is the library you want to install and the `!` tells Google that this line of code is not Python, but is something for the underlying computer (the cloud computer) to do. In fact, you saw it above if, where we downloaded data directly from NOAA. \n","\n","`pip install` is a command to install the library or package you want.

It's poorly-written, which is unfortunate, but the thing to know is that a lot of climate science data are as standardized as possible, and the netcdf format is really helpful in that regard.
